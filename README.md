VIM Clutch by Aleksandr Levchuk

VIM Clutch is a hardware pedal for improving text editing speed of VIM (<a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">1</a>, <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html">2</a>) users. When pressed down, the pedal types "i" causing VIM to go into Insert Mode. When released, it types &lt;Esc&gt; and you are back in Normal Mode.

I just made one and it works great. Here is how I did it.

1. Purchased 2 USB foot switches (pedals) from China:
I used Ankaka.com and payed US$20.34 for 2 pedals and shipping to California. <br />
Later I found out the OEM: PC sensor http://www.pcsensor.com/index.php?_a=viewProd&productId=2 $5.50 per pedal

2. The peddal is programmable via a Windows GUI, which came on a CD. Once programmed you can plug it into any Mac or Linux and it will work.

3. Unfortunately, only the Pedal Down event is programmable. But we need to be able to press &lt;Esc&gt; as the pedal is release. I emailed PC sensor, reaching out to collaborate but I just got the pedals from the post office today and really wanted it to work. So I stated hacking at it and came up with a solution.
